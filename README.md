## 👋 Hello! Bonjour!

I'm Naïm, a passionate web and software developer since 2007 with a diverse skill set in various programming languages. My journey started in Morocco, and now I'm grateful to be traveling the world, experiencing new places and cultures while working on exciting development projects. 🌍✈️

I enjoy crafting beautiful and functional websites and software, and I have a keen interest in keeping up with the latest technologies and trends. My experience spans front-end and back-end development, and I am always eager to learn and tackle new challenges. 💻🚀

I am fluent in multiple programming languages, including C#, Go, JavaScript, Python, Ruby, and PHP. I enjoy meeting people and exploring different cultures, which enriches my perspective and creativity in my work. 🤝🌎

Feel free to get in touch if you wish to connect. Please note that I am currently not available for hire, but I'm always open to connecting with fellow developers and tech enthusiasts. 📧🌟
